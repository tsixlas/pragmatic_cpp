# Building the source code
 
## All together
`mkdir build` <br/>
`cd build` <br/>
`cmake ..` <br/>
`make` <br/>

The folder build should contain the binaries in folders with the same name (e.g. LoggingMacros/LoggingMacros)

## Individual example
For example for the SystemInfo example:
`cd SystemInfo` <br/>
`mkdir build` <br/>
`cd build` <br/>
`cmake ..` <br/>
`make` <br/>

The folder build (that has been created in the SystemInfo folder) contain the SystemInfo binary
